##leapclient

This is the JavaScript implementation of a leaps client. It holds a very simplistic internal model for processing incoming and outgoing transforms.

To test:

```bash
sudo npm install nodeunit -g
nodeunit test_leapclient.js
```

STATUS: NOT TESTED

TODO:

- Create basic auto tests and more in depth user story tests
- Regularly review and improve tests for client API
