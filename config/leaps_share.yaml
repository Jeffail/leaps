#                               ================                               #
#                                                                              #
# This is a configuration for sharing the files in a directory simply by       #
# navigating to that directory and running leaps.                              #
#                                                                              #
# You can then edit any of the files using the web interface at                #
# http://localhost:8001                                                        #
#                                                                              #
# To invite other engineers to edit with you simply link them to your LAN IP   #
# (e.g. http://192.168.0.134:8001)                                             #
#                                                                              #
# There are three important set up steps:                                      #
# - Move the leaps folder anywhere (/opt/leaps is good)                        #
# - Copy this conf file into the root of the folder (/opt/leaps/config.yaml)   #
# - OPTIONAL: Add the bin directory to your PATH variable (/opt/leaps/bin)     #
#                                                                              #
# Then use it like this:                                                       #
#  ( cd /dir/that/i/want/to/share && leaps )                                   #
#                                                                              #
# Or, if you didn't add it to your PATH:                                       #
#  ( cd /dir/that/i/want/to/share && /opt/leaps/bin/leaps )                    #
#                                                                              #
