Static
======

This directory contains a number of client implementations for leaps deployments. Some are designed as simple examples, whereas the share_dir client is designed for file based sharing over LAN, and the stats client is designed as a user friendly web interface for reading leaps stats.

These folders link to built client libraries, so to use them you need to build the project with `make`.
